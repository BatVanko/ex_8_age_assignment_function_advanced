# ex_8_age_assignment_function_advanced

Create a function called age_assignment() that receives a different number of names and a different number of key-value pairs. The key will be a single letter (the first letter of each name) and the value - a number (age). Find its first letter in the key-value pairs for each name and assign the age to the person's name.
Then, sort the names in ascending order (alphabetically) and return the information for each person on a new line in the format: "{name} is {age} years old."

Test Code
print(age_assignment("Peter", "George", G=26, P=19))

Output
George is 26 years old.
Peter is 19 years old.
